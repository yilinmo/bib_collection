These definitions utilize the properties of the Prokhorov distance between probability distributions. It is proved that weak ∗-continuous functionals on the space of probability distributions define robust sequences of estimators (in either sense). The concept of the "breakdown point" of a sequence of estimators is defined, and some examples are given.},

abstract = {In recent years there has been much interest in robustness issues in general and in robust signal processing schemes in particular. Robust schemes are useful in situations where imprecise a priori knowledge of input characteristics makes the sensitivity of perfor- mance to deviations from assumed conditions an important factor in the design of good signal processing schemes. In this survey we discuss the minimax approach for the design of robust methods for signal processing. This has proven to be a very useful approach because it leads to constructive procedures for designing robust schemes. Our emphasis is on the contributions which have been made in robust signal processing, although key results of other robust statistical procedures are also considered. Most of the results we survey have been obtained in the past fifteen years, although some interesting earlier ideas for minimax signal processing are also mentioned. This survey is organized into five main parts, which deal sep- arately with robust linear filters for signal estimation, robust linear filters for signal detection and related applications, nonlinear meth- ods for robust signal detection, nonlinear methods for robust esti- mation, and robust data quantization. The interrelationships among many of these results are also discussed in the survey.},

It is shown that this estimator can be chosen with a maximal breakdown point of. 5. Moreover, strong consistency and asymptotic normality (with convergence rate n ?1/2 of the proposed estimator are proved under various regularity conditions. Because the objective function generally is not convex in the regression parameters, the usual proofs of asymptotic normality do not carry over. Instead the proof is based on an asymptotic linearity result, similar to that obtained by Huber for M estimates, and some moment estimates for signed rank statistics. Numerical examples illustrate the behavior of the estimator.},

abstract = {This work addresses the problem of ensuring trustworthy computation in a linear consensus network. A solution to this problem is relevant for several tasks in multi-agent systems including motion coordination, clock synchronization, and cooperative estimation. In a linear consensus network, we allow for the presence of misbehaving agents, whose behavior deviate from the nominal consensus evolution. We model misbehaviors as unknown and unmeasurable inputs affecting the network, and we cast the misbehavior detection and identification problem into an unknown-input system theoretic framework. We consider two extreme cases of misbehaving agents, namely faulty (non-colluding) and malicious (Byzantine) agents. First, we characterize the set of inputs that allow misbehaving agents to affect the consensus network while remaining undetected and/or unidentified from certain observing agents. Second, we provide worst-case bounds for the number of concurrent faulty or malicious agents that can be detected and identified. Precisely, the consensus network needs to be 2k+1 (resp. k+1) connected for k malicious (resp. faulty) agents to be generically detectable and identifiable by every well behaving agent. Third, we quantify the effect of undetectable inputs on the final consensus value. Fourth, we design three algorithms to detect and identify misbehaving agents. The first and the second algorithm apply fault detection techniques, and affords complete detection and identification if global knowledge of the network is available to each agent, at a high computational cost. The third algorithm is designed to exploit the presence in the network of weakly interconnected subparts, and provides local detection and identification of misbehaving agents whose behavior deviates more than a threshold, which is quantified in terms of the interconnection structure.},

Many authors have produced more robust versions of this estimator by replacing the square by something else, such as the absolute value. In this article a different approach is introduced in which the sum is replaced by the median of the squared residuals. The resulting estimator can resist the effect of nearly 50\% of contamination in the data. In the special case of simple regression, it corresponds to finding the narrowest strip covering half of the observations. Generalizations are possible to multivariate location, orthogonal regression, and hypothesis testing in linear models.},

The estimates have simultaneously the following properties: (a) they are qualitatively robust, (b) their breakdown point is .5, and (c) they are highly efficient for regression models with normal errors. They are defined by minimizing a new scale estimate, $\tau$, applied to the residuals. Asymptotically, a $\tau$ estimate is equivalent to an M estimate with a $\psi$ function given by a weighted average of two $\psi$ functions, one corresponding to a very robust estimate and the other to a highly efficient estimate. The weights are adaptive and depend on the underlying error distribution. We prove consistency and asymptotic normality and give a convergent iterative computing algorithm. Finally, we compare the biases produced by gross error contamination in the $\tau$ estimates and optimal bounded-influence estimates.},

As a man-in-the-middle state attack, a data framing attack is proposed to exploit the bad data detection and identification mechanisms currently in use at most control centers. In particular, the proposed attack frames meters that are providing correct data as sources of bad data such that the control center will remove useful measurements that would otherwise be used by the state estimator. The optimal design of a data framing attack is formulated as a quadratically constrained quadratic program. It is shown that the proposed attack is capable of perturbing the power system state estimate by an arbitrary degree controlling only half of a critical set of measurements that are needed to make a system unobservable. Implications of this attack on power system operations are discussed, and the attack performance is evaluated using benchmark systems.},

abstract = {In this paper, we study stealthy false-data attacks against state estimators in power networks. The focus is on applications in SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) systems where measurement data is corrupted by a malicious attacker. We introduce two security indices for the state estimators. The indices quantify the least effort needed to achieve attack goals while avoiding bad-data alarms in the power network control center (stealthy attacks). The indices depend on the physical topology of the power network and the available measurements, and can help the system operator to identify sparse data manipulation patterns. This information can be used to strengthen the security by allocating encryption devices, for example. The analysis is also complemented with a convex optimization framework that can be used to evaluate more complex attacks taking model deviations and multiple attack goals into account. The security indices are finally computed in an example. It is seen that a large measurement redundancy forces the attacker to use large magnitudes in the data manipulation pattern, but that the pattern still can be relatively sparse.},

Consequently, in this work we present a method for state estimation in presence of attacks, for systems with noise and modeling errors. When the the estimated states are used by a state-based feedback controller, we show that the attacker cannot destabilize the system by exploiting the difference between the model used for the state estimation and the real physical dynamics of the system. Furthermore, we describe how implementation issues such as jitter, latency and synchronization errors can be mapped into parameters of the state estimation procedure that describe modeling errors, and provide a bound on the state-estimation error caused by modeling errors. This enables mapping control performance requirements into real-time (i.e., timing related) specifications imposed on the underlying platform. Finally, we illustrate and experimentally evaluate this approach on an unmanned ground vehicle case-study.},

abstract = {The vast majority of today's critical infrastructure is supported by numerous feedback control loops and an attack on these control loops can have disastrous consequences. This is a major concern since modern control systems are becoming large and decentralized and thus more vulnerable to attacks. This paper is concerned with the estimation and control of linear systems when some of the sensors or actuators are corrupted by an attacker. We give a new simple characterization of the maximum number of attacks that can be detected and corrected as a function of the pair (A,C) of the system and we show in particular that it is impossible to accurately reconstruct the state of a system if more than half the sensors are attacked. In addition, we show how the design of a secure local control loop can improve the resilience of the system. When the number of attacks is smaller than a threshold, we propose an efficient algorithm inspired from techniques in compressed sensing to estimate the state of the plant despite attacks. We give a theoretical characterization of the performance of this algorithm and we show on numerical simulations that the method is promising and allows to reconstruct the state accurately despite attacks. Finally, we consider the problem of designing output-feedback controllers that stabilize the system despite sensor attacks. We show that a principle of separation between estimation and control holds and that the design of resilient output feedback controllers can be reduced to the design of resilient state estimators.},

abstract = {The resilience of Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems for electric power networks for certain cyber-attacks is considered. We analyze the vulnerability of the measurement system to false data attack on communicated measurements. The vulnerability analysis problem is shown to be NP-hard, meaning that unless P=NP there is no polynomial time algorithm to analyze the vulnerability of the system. Nevertheless, we identify situations, such as the full measurement case, where the analysis problem can be solved efficiently. In such cases, we show indeed that the problem can be cast as a generalization of the minimum cut problem involving nodes with possibly nonzero costs. We further show that it can be reformulated as a standard minimum cut problem (without node costs) on a modified graph of proportional size. An important consequence of this result is that our approach provides the first exact efficient algorithm for the vulnerability analysis problem under the full measurement assumption. Furthermore, our approach also provides an efficient heuristic algorithm for the general NP-hard problem. Our results are illustrated by numerical studies on benchmark systems including the IEEE 118-bus system.},

Our motivation is derived from vehicle control problems where information is communicated via a wireless local area network. For such problems, we consider a simple packet-loss model for the communicated information and note that results for discrete-time linear systems with Markovian jumping parameters can be applied. The goal is to find a controller (if one exists) such that the closed loop is mean square stable for a given packet loss rate. A linear matrix inequality (LMI) condition is developed for the existence of a stabilizing dynamic output feedback controller. This LMI condition is used to study the effect of communication losses on a vehicle following problem. In summary, these results can be used not only to design controllers but also give a 'worst-case' performance specification (in terms of packet-loss rate) for an acceptable communications system},

The detection problem is formulated as a minimax optimization, where one seeks to construct an optimal detector that minimizes the “worst-case” probability of error against all possible manipulations by the attacker.

abstract = {Cyberphysical systems (CPSs) refer to the embedding of widespread sensing, networking, computation, and control into physical spaces with the goal of making them safer, more efficient, and reliable. Driven by the miniaturization and integration of sensing, communication, and computation in cost-efficient devices, CPSs are bound to transform industries such as aerospace, transportation, built environments, energy, health care, and manufacturing, to name a few. This great opportunity, unfortunately, is matched by even greater challenges. Taming the complexity of design and analysis of these systems poses a fundamental problem as a new paradigm is needed to bridge various scientific domains, which, through the years, have developed significantly different formalisms and methodologies. In addition, while the use of dedicated communication networks has so far sheltered systems from the outside world, use of off-the-shelf networking and computing, combined with the unattended operation of a plethora of devices, provides several opportunities for malicious entities to inject attacks on CPSs. A wide variety of motivations exists for launching an attack on CPSs, ranging from economic reasons, such as obtaining a financial gain, all the way to terrorism, for instance, threatening an entire population by manipulating life-critical resources. Any attack on safety-critical CPSs may significantly hamper the economy and lead to the loss of human lives. While the threat of attacks on CPSs tends to be underplayed at times, the Stuxnet worm provided a clear example of the possible future to come. This malware, targeting a uranium enriching facility in Iran, managed to reach the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system controlling the centrifuges used in the enrichment process. Stuxnet modified the control system, increasing pressure in the centrifuges in a first version of the worm and spinning centrifuges in an erratic fashion in a second version. As a result, Stuxne- caused significant damage to the plant [1]. For details, see "The Stuxnet Attack".},

@article{Dion2003,
abstract = {In this survey paper, we consider linear structured systems in state space form, where a linear system is structured when each entry of its matrices, like A,B,C and D, is either a fixed zero or a free parameter. The location of the fixed zeros in these matrices constitutes the structure of the system. Indeed a lot of man-made physical systems which admit a linear model are structured. A structured system is representative of a class of linear systems in the usual sense. It is of interest to investigate properties of structured systems which are true for almost any value of the free parameters, therefore also called generic properties. Interestingly, a lot of classical properties of linear systems can be studied in terms of genericity. Moreover, these generic properties can, in general, be checked by means of directed graphs that can be associated to a structured system in a natural way. We review here a number of results concerning generic properties of structured systems expressed in graph theoretic terms. By properties we mean here system-specific properties like controllability, the finite and infinite zero structure, and so on, as well as, solvability issues of certain classical control problems like disturbance rejection, input–output decoupling, and so on. In this paper, we do not try to be exhaustive but instead, by a selection of results, we would like to motivate the reader to appreciate what we consider as a wonderful modelling and analysis tool. We emphasize the fact that this modelling technique allows us to get a number of important results based on poor information on the system only. Moreover, the graph theoretic conditions are intuitive and are easy to check by hand for small systems and by means of well-known polynomially bounded combinatorial techniques for larger systems.},

These conditions are more general than the existing ones in the sense that they only require the state matrix of the system to be diagonalizable and the sequence of packet losses to be a stationary finite order Markov process. Hence, we extend the class of systems for which these conditions are known in two directions, namely, by including degenerate systems, and by considering network models more general than i.i.d. and Gilbert-Elliott. We show that these conditions recover known results from the literature when evaluated for non-degenerate systems under the assumption of i.i.d. or Gilbert-Elliott packet loss models.},

abstract = {State estimation using wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is an important technique in many commercial and military applications, in which a group of (nonidentical) sensors take noisy observations of system state and send back to a fusion center for state estimation through wireless broadcasting. In order to minimize the estimated state error covariance at a terminal stage at the fusion center, a partial broadcasting policy should tell which sensors to broadcast at each stage. The limited battery allows each sensor to broadcast only a few number of times. The limited wireless communication bandwidth allows only a few number of sensors to broadcast in the same time. Due to the aforementioned two couplings, the optimal partial broadcasting policy is not clear in general. Despite the abundant applications of partial broadcasting policies, theoretical analysis is rare. In this paper, we consider the scalar state estimation and provide a first study on the properties of optimal partial broadcasting policies. When there is no packet drop, a good-sensor-late-broadcast (GSLB) rule is shown to perform optimally. When there is a positive probability for packet drop, theoretical analysis suggests that the GSLB rule also has good performance.},

It is important for a designer to determine the set of all the estimation biases that an attacker can inject into the system without being detected, providing a quantitative measure of the resilience of the system to such attacks.

Fisher linear discriminant analysis (FLDA) techniques are often employed to elucidate and visualize important information that discriminates between two or more populations. We demonstrate that the direct application of FLDA can lead to undesirable errors in characterizing such information and that the reason for such errors is not necessarily the ill conditioning in the resulting generalized eigenvalue problem, as usually assumed. We show that the regularized eigenvalue decomposition often used is related to solving a modified FLDA criterion that includes a least-squares-type representation penalty, and derive the relationship explicitly.

However, the attacker has limited resources and can only manipulate n of the m measurements. The problem is formulated as a minimax optimization, where one seeks to construct an optimal detector that minimizes the ``worst-case\{''\} probability of error against all possible manipulations by the attacker. We show that if the attacker can manipulate at least half the measurements (n >= m/2) then the optimal worst-case estimator should ignore all m measurements and be based solely on the a-priori information. When the attacker can manipulate less than half the measurements (n < m/2), we show that the optimal estimator is a threshold rule based on a Hamming-like distance between the (manipulated) measurement vector and two appropriately defined sets.
